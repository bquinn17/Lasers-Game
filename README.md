# Lasers-Game

This is game that we completed for our final project in class. It is written entirely in Java and used the Java 8 GUI framework. Some of the project files were outlined for us, but all of the code was implemented by my partener and I.

The key part of this project is that it uses a recurive depth first search algorithm in order to find a solution, given an input. This part was written entirely by me. It also follows the MVC design concept for creating graphical user interfaces.

The program can be run from the command line or ide by running the lasers.java file, a usage message will be provided when running. You can select from the test files provided. Once you have the game launched, you can play the game or click the solve button to complete the safe.
